# Use sentiment analysis to extract customer sentiments for product functionality
This analysis is based of 34,000 consumer reviews for Amazon products like Kindle, Fire TV etc. The full dataset is provided by Datainfiniti's Product Database upon creating an account with them. The dataset includes basic product information, ratings review text and more for each product. Sample public dataset is available here - https://www.kaggle.com/datafiniti/consumer-reviews-of-amazon-products. For the capstone I will analyze the bigger dataset consisting of reviews for more than millions of customer reviews accessed through API.

Project Proposal: Customers are generally shopping for products looking for some specific functionalities. For example, a tablet with really good camera. It can be useful to extract the positive sentiment associated with product specs and negative sentiment associated with product specs and highlight it for new customers. It can also be useful for product manufacturer to understand what customers think of their products.
